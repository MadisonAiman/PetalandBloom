**Petal & Bloom**

**Purpose**
Petal & Bloom is a responsive florist website designed to showcase the beauty of floral arrangements and services offered in Las Cruces, NM. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows customers to explore our offerings, learn about our services, and read testimonials from satisfied clients. The website serves as an online presence for the business, promoting its passion for flowers and enhancing customer engagement.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: For structuring the content and layout of the website.
CSS: For styling the website and ensuring a visually appealing user experience.
JavaScript: To enhance interactivity and create dynamic features such as testimonials, smooth scrolling, and a back-to-top button.

**Features**
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on devices of all sizes.
Carousel Testimonials: A rotating testimonial feature displays customer feedback, showcasing the quality of our services.
Smooth Scroll Navigation: Users can navigate through sections of the website smoothly by clicking anchor tags.
Back to Top Button: A user-friendly button allows visitors to quickly return to the top of the page.
Dynamic Testimonials: JavaScript rotates through customer testimonials every six seconds, providing fresh content for visitors.

**Optimizations**
If more time were available, I would address these ideas:

Separate Pages for Each Section: Each section of the website could be transformed into its own dedicated page, improving organization and ease of navigation.
Improved Testimonial Functionality: A more complex testimonial system could be implemented, allowing users to submit their own reviews directly on the website.
Enhanced Image Gallery: A dedicated gallery showcasing various floral arrangements with filters for different categories (e.g., weddings, gifts, etc.) could enhance user experience.
